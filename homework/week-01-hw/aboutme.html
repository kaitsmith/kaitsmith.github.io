		<h2>Hi! I'm Kait.</h2>
		<p>I grew up in Rockland County, NY but now live in the big city! These days, I spend my time in sunny Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. When I'm not busy designing beautiful experiences, I restore old furniture, go on bike rides, collect vinyl and antique books, work on the herb garden on my fire escape, and hang out with my crazy cat Camille.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Though I earned an undergraduate degree in Graphic Design, I worked as a publicist for Moleskine, Internet Week New York, Rolling Stone Magazine, and Disney ABC before becoming a User Experience Designer.</p>
